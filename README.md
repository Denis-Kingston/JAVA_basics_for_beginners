# Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects designed to help you learn and practice core Java concepts. Each project focuses on different aspects of Java programming, from basic syntax and data structures to more advanced concepts.

**1. Calculator App**

* **Description:** A simple calculator program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). 
* **Learning Objectives:**
    * Basic input/output (I/O) using the console.
    * Handling user input and basic error handling.
    * Conditional statements (if/else).
    * Basic arithmetic operations.

**2. Contact Book**

* **Description:** A program that allows users to store and manage a list of contacts, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses.
* **Learning Objectives:**
    * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts: classes, objects, and methods.
    * Data structures: ArrayList or other suitable data structures to store contacts.
    * User interaction and menu-driven interfaces.
    * File I/O for saving and loading contact data.

**3. Quiz Application**

* **Description:** A multiple-choice quiz program that loads questions from a file, presents them to the user, and keeps track of the score.
* **Learning Objectives:**
    * File handling: reading data from external files.
    * Working with arrays or lists to store questions and answers.
    * Random number generation for selecting questions.
    * User input validation and error handling.
    * Basic game logic and scoring mechanisms.

**4. Todo List App**

* **Description:** A command-line Todo List application that allows users to add, remove, and mark tasks as completed.
* **Learning Objectives:**
    * Data structures: ArrayList to store tasks.
    * User interaction and command-line input.
    * Object-Oriented Programming: creating a `Task` class with attributes like description and completion status.
    * Basic user interface design for a command-line application.
